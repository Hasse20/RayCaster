# C++ GLFW Raycaster

This project is a C++ raycaster implemented using GLFW. It efficiently renders a 3D scene with collisions in a 10x10 map.

## Features

- Efficient raycasting algorithm
- Collision detection within the map
- Simple and clean C++ codebase
- Uses GLFW for window management

## Requirements

- C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later
- GLFW library
